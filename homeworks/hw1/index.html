            Heyo! I'm a junior studying CS and CogSci. I'm a pretty introverted person but I love talking to and meeting people.
            I recently fell in love with Trader Joes' porcini mushroom and truffle ravioli, which I make in combination with 
            Gigi Hadid's pasta sauce recipe every week with my roommate. College converted me into a coffee person 
            so I've been trying to visit as many cafés in the Bay Area as I can. I would recommend trying out the Hidden Café 
            in Central Berkeley! It's a quick bus ride over, but it has a beautiful interior design and wonderful drinks. <br>
            <br>
            I'm interested in UI/UX design, product design, and web design & development -- honestly any digital user-facing design 
            field. Outside of that, I enjoy dancing, making playlists, and reading outdoors!
            <br>
            <br>
            Favorite places to eat in Berkeley:
            <li>Toss Noodle Bar</li>
            <li>Little Plearn Thai Kitchen</li>
            <li>T-Toust</li>

            <ul>This was a really cool read. I learned that the best way to learn design is to think from a designer's
                perspective! I enjoyed reading through the examples the author gave and I will definitely give it a try.

                My favorite part of the article was the observations on the search bar for Airbnb. It's such a small detail
                but it can definitely change the mindset of the user when they see it. That note made me realize that there are
                so many parts of an app or website that I gloss over without thinking how much of a psychological impact it's making
                to my decision-making and navigation of the platform.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                "be curious about everything you see and think through the choices that had to be made"
            </ul>
            <ul>
                10/10! What made me really enjoy this article were the GIFs and specific observations that were made
                for all the apps. I learn better with examples and visual content so this article really helped.
